No one ever thought that the first quarter of 2020 would be dominated by heart-rending events- from multiple fire disasters to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  

The world was aware of a virus ravaging the indigenes of Wuhan in China; what the world didn’t know, however, was that the virus would spread beyond Asia. After laying waste to some parts of Europe, the novel coronavirus decided to take a stroll in Africa.  

One of the African countries hit by this virus was Nigeria. On the 27th of February 2020, Nigeria recorded its first COVID-19 case.  

Since then, the number of confirmed cases has been on the rise with Lagos hosting over half of the infected persons.

President Muhammadu Buhari declared a 2-week nationwide lockdown beginning from March 30th forcing markets, schools, corporate organizations and even places of worship to halt operations. 

Augustine University Ilara was not left out of this exercise. Even before the President’s announcement, the NUC had already sent a memo to all higher institutions asking them to round off their activities in order to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Following reports of more confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, the Federal Government extended the lockdown order by another 2 weeks. With this extension, the feeling of uncertainty gripped the minds of every Nigerian.  

No one knows when the epidemic will dwindle, the race for finding a cure for this virus is becoming exhausting and hopelessness has almost taken over the land. Part of what this epidemic has suspended is the education of children worldwide. Academic calendars have been put on hold with no idea of when schools will be asked to resume.  

Leaving nothing to chance, AUI has been monitoring the situation in the country and strategizing on how to keep the students busy during this seemingly unending holiday. Memos have constantly been sent to parents, guardians and students, keeping them up-to-date with the university’s plans.

One of such ways to engage AUI students is the adoption of an online classroom scheme, bearing in mind that the suspension of formal education has contributed to the increase of idleness among students and worry among guardians/parents. By employing the on-line classroom initiative, the university is creating a safe and viable alternative to ensure the health of students and staff alike. With distance learning technology in place, schools like Augustine University can continue to operate within the safety of their own homes.  

As AUI and the rest of world anticipate an end to this pandemic, everyone is encouraged to learn a new skill via YouTube as well as “foster family bonding and union with God”, according to the Vice-Chancellor of Augustine University Ilara, Professor S.O. Afolami.
