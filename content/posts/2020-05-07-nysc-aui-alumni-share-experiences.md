Apart from promoting peace, reconciliation, rehabilitation, reconstruction and national unity, the NYSC also contributes to the growth of the individual person. From the 3-week orientation camp to the community development service (CDS) to the SAED (Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development) scheme, the National Youth Service Corps is so committed to the development of Nigerian youths and the nation at large.  

Over half of AUI’s alumni, together with Nigerian graduates from other tertiary institutions, are currently serving their fatherland (Nigeria).

According to Collins Ireroa (ECO ’19), “three weeks in Yikpata, Kwara was a bittersweet one. I honestly disliked the sound of the bugle at every point as well as the cold nights in camp. I however enjoyed my time there cause I got to be the official camp DJ plus I made new friends there, including the soldiers”. Acknowledging that some camp activities were rigorous, “the camp stress taught me resilience” he said. Collins who graduated with an Economics degree was assigned to Princess Luxury Hotel which was “bizarre at the beginning”. With no clue of how the hospitality industry worked, he had to learn a few things if he was going to excel in his work environment. That is what the NYSC does to you; it exposes you to new surroundings. Initially disappointed about not getting deployed to Lagos, Collins is really happy about his decision to remain in Kwara state.

For Theresa Izokpu (MCB ’19) who works as a med lab assistant in Sacred Heart Hospital, Ogun state, the NYSC has made her “grateful for a lot of things”. Her position as a platoon leader in camp gave her the opportunity to display her leadership skills. “Leading a group of people with different personalities was no easy task but I sure did my best”, she said. Though the weather was not favourable to her, Theresa was not willing to give up her camp experience. It was after camp that it really dawned on her that she had to live in a state where she totally had no family. Not one to shy away from adventures, Theresa was able to settle in just fine. “My work and camp experiences so far, have impacted my growth into a phenomenal woman”, she mentioned.

“Besides worrying about living in an environment without much technology, I was disturbed by the mere thought of living with soldiers. Interestingly, soldiers in Zamfara are quite friendly”, Vangerwua Johnpaul (CSC ’19) said. It was their friendliness that even motivated him to actively participate in the Man ‘O war activities at camp. “NYSC has taught me the true meaning of endurance”, he stated. Johnpaul is determined to combine the lessons from orientation camp with his AUI-instilled intellect to make a name for himself in the labour market.  

With other alumni doing really well at their various PPAs- be it as media personalities, tech consultants, teachers or human resource assistants- it is safe to say that the NYSC program is a wonderful platform (outside the education sector) for Nigerian youths to carve a niche for themselves and connect with other cultures.
