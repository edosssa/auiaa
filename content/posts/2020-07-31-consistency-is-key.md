Dear Reader, 

It gives me great pleasure to share the second edition of our AUIAA publication with you. 

In this edition, we take a close look on the importance of face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic. The role of sex education in curbing sexual abuse is also discussed. 

This edition also includes feature stories on two wonderful alumni- one with a passion for music and the other with a flair for entrepreneurship. 

The need for alumni-student networking is also included in this publication as well as interesting facts about our patron saint, St Augustine of Hippo. A list of competitions and educational opportunities is likewise introduced in this second edition.

As always, I invite you to read and enjoy every article in this AUIAA publication.  

Regards, 

Nwadinigwe Clara.
