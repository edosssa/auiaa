Dear Alumni,

On behalf of the Executive Council of the Augustine University Ilara Alumni Association, I present the first edition of our quarterly publication. 

It’s been six months since the birth of this alumni association, and I must say that it’s been a lovely journey thus far. Since the formation and inauguration of this association in October 2019, the members of the Executive Council have worked tirelessly to ensure that the association is geared towards the right direction and fulfills the purpose for which it was formed. 

So far, a constitution has been put in place to ensure proper governance of the association, and committees have been constituted to guide the association’s strategy in various areas. Also, we have created various social media accounts to aid better communication with our alumni and other stakeholders of the association.  The association is at a very early stage, and a lot of work has to be done. It is my hope therefore that we work together for the growth of Augustine University and our Association.

I have no doubt that our best days as an association are yet to come. With your support, oneness of purpose and collective effort, we will make this association, the Augustine University Ilara Alumni Association, a prestigious one. 

Yours truly, 

Onyia Emmanuel.

**(President, AUIAA)**
