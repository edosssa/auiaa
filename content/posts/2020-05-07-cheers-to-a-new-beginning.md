Dear Reader, 

It gives me so much joy to share the very first AUIAA publication with you. 

The Augustine University Ilara Alumni Association is in its formative years and as such, there is great need for us to build a network of people aside our AUI family. 
By creating this editorial strategy therefore, we are raising awareness for ourselves and our alma mater, Augustine University Ilara.  

This maiden publication introduces you to the pioneer set of AUIAA EXCOs. In addition, you will be offered an insight into the novel coronavirus and its impact on humanity. News about the NYSC experiences of some alumni is also featured in this edition. 

So, I invite you to read and enjoy every article in this maiden publication. 
While your patronage is anticipated, your suggestions, comments as well as criticism will be highly appreciated.

Welcome to our world.

Regards,
Nwadinigwe Clara.
