Official blog of the Augustine University ALumni Association.

## Start Developing

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd blog
gatsby develop
```

## Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
